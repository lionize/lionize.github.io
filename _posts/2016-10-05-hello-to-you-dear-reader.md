Hello to you, dear reader.

Thank you for joining me on this journey through time. Hopefully my thoughts will take you somewhere, enable you to solve problems, avoid pitfalls I've already been through, or simply make you smile.

My goals for this site:

* Freedom: I've spent most of my life running from my own voice. I let myself be silenced by bullies as a child and I internalized their voices. No more.
* Honesty: I have nothing to fear in expressing what is in my heart and mind.
* Attention to Detail: I have a tendency to half-ass and skimp on detail. I want to document solutions that I have found or problems that I have struggled with, to help myself and others understand and learn.

I hope that at the end of the day we both come away having learned something new.
