  If you're reading this, please be sure to check out Tessera, an open source alternative to Jira, Bugzilla, etc. It is the focus of all of my hopes and dreams right now. We'd like to create a beautiful, easy-to-use ticketing system to help the masses organize their projects, and we'd love to have you join us!

Hello! My name is Mark and I do my best to CARRY THE FIRE. I am intent on using my life to GROW LOVE, and I push hard to LIONIZE myself in order to accomplish this outcome.

Valor | Ferocity | Conviction | Strength | Leadership | Heart

I currently work for Kroger where we strive to FEED THE HUMAN SPIRIT through giving, partnership, cooperation, and community participation. I am proud to work for a company that aligns itself with creating a better world while enabling me to better myself and achieve personal goals.

## Current Projects

I am currently working on two projects:

* [Tessera](https://github.com/chasinglogic/tessera)
* [Tessera-Client](https://github.com/lionize/tessera-client)

## Miscellania

Have questions or suggestions? Feel free to [open an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/lionize/lionize.github.io/issues) or [ask me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/grow_love).

Thanks for reading!
